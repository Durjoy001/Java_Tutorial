A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
You can pass data, known as parameters, into a method.

Why use methods?
To reuse code: define the code once, and use it many times.

A method must be declared within a class. It is defined with the name of the method, followed by parentheses (). 
Java provides some pre-defined methods, such as System.out.println(), 
but you can also create your own methods to perform certain actions.
