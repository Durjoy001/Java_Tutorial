### [Polymorphism in Java](https://www.javatpoint.com/runtime-polymorphism-in-java)      
**Polymorphism in Java is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways.**    Polymorphism is derived from 2 Greek words: poly and morphs. The word "poly" means many and "morphs" means forms. So polymorphism means many forms.   

**There are two types of polymorphism in Java: compile-time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism.** We can perform polymorphism in java by method overloading and method overriding.  

**If we overload a static method in Java, it is the example of compile time polymorphism.**   

**Runtime polymorphism or Dynamic Method Dispatch is a process in which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime rather than compile-time.**   

### Upcasting:   
**If the reference variable of Parent class refers to the object of Child class, it is known as upcasting.**
