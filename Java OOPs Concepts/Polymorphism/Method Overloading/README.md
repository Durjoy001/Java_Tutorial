### [Method Overloading](https://www.javatpoint.com/method-overloading-in-java)   
**If a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters, it is known as Method Overloading.**  
Method overloading increases the readability of the program.     

There are two ways to overload the method in java  
* By changing number of arguments   
* By changing the data type of arguments   
 
**In Java, Method Overloading is not possible by changing the return type of the method only.**
