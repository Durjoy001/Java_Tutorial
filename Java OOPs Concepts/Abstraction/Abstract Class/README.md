### [:boom:Abstract class in Java](https://www.javatpoint.com/abstract-class-in-java)  
**Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.**   

**There are two ways to achieve abstraction in java**   
* Abstract class (0 to 100%)  
* Interface (100%)  

**A class which is declared as abstract keyword is known as an abstract class. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods. It needs to be extended and its method implemented.**   

**A method which is declared as abstract keyword and does not have implementation is known as an abstract method.**
