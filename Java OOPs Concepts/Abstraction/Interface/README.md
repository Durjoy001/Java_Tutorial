### [:boom: Interface in Java](https://www.javatpoint.com/interface-in-java)    
**An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class.**   

**The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction. There can be only abstract methods in the Java interface, not method body. It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.**   
In other words, you can say that interfaces can have abstract methods and variables. It cannot have a method body.   

**Why use Java interface?**  
* It is used to achieve abstraction.  
* By interface, we can support the functionality of multiple inheritance.  
* It can be used to achieve loose coupling.   
 
**Interface fields are public, static and final by default, and the methods are public and abstract by default.**
