[**JAVA OPPs concepts**](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-oops-concepts)  
  
**Object:**  
**Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. For example, a chair, pen, table, keyboard, bike, etc. It can be physical or logical.**  

**Class:**  
**Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity.**    
A class can also be defined as a blueprint from which you can create an individual object.   

**Inheritance:**  
**When one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object, it is known as inheritance. It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.**  
 
**Polymorphism:**  
**If one task is performed in different ways, it is known as polymorphism.**
For example: to convince the customer differently, to draw something, for example, shape, triangle, rectangle, etc.
**Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks. This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.**  
**In Java, we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.**  

**Abstraction:  
Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction.** For example phone call, we don't know the internal processing.
**In Java, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.**  

**Encapsulation:  
Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit are known as encapsulation. For example, a capsule, it is wrapped with different medicines.  
A java class is the example of encapsulation. Java bean is the fully encapsulated class because all the data members are private here.  
The meaning of Encapsulation, is to make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users.**  

**Coupling:  
Coupling refers to the knowledge or information or dependency of another class.**  

**Cohesion:  
Cohesion refers to the level of a component which performs a single well-defined task. A single well-defined task is done by a highly cohesive method. The weakly cohesive method will split the task into separate parts.**   

**What is the difference between an object-oriented programming language and object-based programming language?**  
**Object-based programming language follows all the features of OOPs except Inheritance. JavaScript and VBScript are examples of object-based programming languages.**
