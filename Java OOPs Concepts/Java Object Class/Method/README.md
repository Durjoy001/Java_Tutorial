### [Method in Java](https://www.javatpoint.com/method-in-java)   
It is used to achieve the **reusability** of code. We write a method once and use it many times. We do not require to write code again and again. It also provides the **easy modification and readability** of code, just by adding or removing a chunk of code. The method is executed only when we call or invoke it.   

Access Specifier: Access specifier or modifier is the access type of the method. It specifies the visibility of the method. Java provides four types of access specifier:   

**Public:** The method is **accessible by all classes** when we use public specifier in our application.     
**Private:** When we use a private access specifier, the method is **accessible only in the classes in which it is defined.**    
**Protected:** When we use protected access specifier, the method is **accessible within the same package or subclasses in a different package.**     
**Default:** When we do not use any access specifier in the method declaration, Java uses default access specifier by default. It is **visible only from the same package only.**
