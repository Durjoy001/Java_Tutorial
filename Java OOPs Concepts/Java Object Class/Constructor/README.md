### [Constructors in Java](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-constructor)   
In Java, a constructor is a block of codes similar to the method.  
It is a special type of method which is used to initialize the object.**Every time an object is created using the new() keyword, at least one constructor is called.**  

### Rules for creating Java constructor   
*  Constructor name must be the same as its class name
*  A Constructor must have no explicit return type
*  A Java constructor cannot be abstract, static, final, and synchronized  

There are two types of constructors in Java:  
* Default constructor (no-arg constructor)(doesn't have any parameter).        
* Parameterized constructor.    

### Constructor Overloading in Java  

**In Java, a constructor is just like a method but without return type. It can also be overloaded like Java methods.**    

Constructor overloading in Java is a technique of having more than one constructor with different parameter lists. They are arranged in a way that each constructor performs a different task. They are differentiated by the compiler by the number of parameters in the list and their types.
