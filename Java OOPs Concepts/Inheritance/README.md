### [Inheritance in Java](https://www.javatpoint.com/inheritance-in-java)   
**Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.**  

The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing classes. When you inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods and fields of the parent class. Moreover, you can add new methods and fields in your current class also.   

**Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship which is also known as a parent-child relationship.**   

Why use inheritance in java:  
* **For Method Overriding (so runtime polymorphism can be achieved).**  
* **For Code Reusability.**   

**Sub Class/Child Class: Subclass is a class which inherits the other class. It is also called a derived class, extended class, or child class.**  
**Super Class/Parent Class: Superclass is the class from where a subclass inherits the features. It is also called a base class or a parent class.**  

The **extends keyword** indicates that you are making a new class that derives from an existing class. The meaning of "extends" is to increase the functionality.
